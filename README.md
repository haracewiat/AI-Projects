# AI Projects

This repository contains AI projects written with the help of the book *"Python Artificial Intelligence Projects for Beginners" (Dr. J. Eckroth, 2018)* to get acquainted with the basic concepts and methods of AI and ML. 

### Projects

The following section lists the projects included in the repository along with a brief description of each. 

- Student performance predictor ([code](DecisionTree/decisionTree.py))
  ```
  Student performance predictor based on the past performance data build with decision trees.
  ```
  
- Reviews classifier ([code](CommentClassification/sentimentAnalysis.py))
  ```
  Reviews classifier built based the Word2Vec/Doc2Vec models for text classification and the gensim Python library. 
  Compared with the performance of the k-nearest neighbors classifier.
  ```
  
- Spam classifier ([code](CommentClassification/spamDetector.py))
  ```
  Spam classifier built based on the bag-of-words and Word2Vec/Doc2Vec models for text classification.
  ```
  
- Spam classifier *[revised]* ([code](CommentClassification/SpamDetectorNN.py))
  ```
  Revised spam classifier to make it work with neural networks. 
  ```
  
- Bird species classifier ([code](RandomForests/birdIdentifier.py))
  ```
  Bird species identifier based on the attributes gives (such as size, shape and colour) built with a random forest. 
  Comparison of its performance with the performance of a decision tree and a Support Vector Machine (SVM).
  ```
  
- Bird species classifier *[revised]* ([code](classifierRandomForests/birdIdentifierCNN.py))
  ```
  Revised bird species identifier based on the provided pictures using neural networks and deep learning.
  ```
  
- Music genre classifier ([code](NeuralNetworks/GenreIdentifier.py))
  ```
  Music genre classifier with Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and the librosa Python library. 
  ```
  
- Handwriting recognition ([code](DeepLearning/HandwrittingMaths.py))
  ```
  Handwriting recognition using a convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
  ```
